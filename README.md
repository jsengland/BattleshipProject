# BattleshipProject

### Description
This project will run two seperate games of an alternative version of battleship. This game creates a server for both players to play at the same time and allow high scores to be stored for any given username. Additionally, using sockets each player can see what moves the other player has made so far in their game. This project uses Node.js and MongoDB.


### How to run this program

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your device.
2. In the "BackEnd" directory run the command "node server.js" in your terminal.
3. Player 1 proceed to the "Player1" directory and launch the "index.html" file in your desired web browser.
4. Player 2 should go to "Player2" directory and launch the "index.html" in your desired web browser.
5. Both players should enter their usernames and play a game of battleship while trying to get the lowest score.
6. Each players score will be displayed on the scoreboard in the "index.html" file.
